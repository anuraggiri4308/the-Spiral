      <p>
        Growth hacking refers to using creative, low-cost strategies to help
        businesses acquire and retain customers. Instead of relying solely
        on traditional marketing, it focuses on quick experimentation across
        marketing channels, product development, and sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Dropbox famously offered free storage space to users
        who referred friends. This viral loop helped them grow exponentially
        without spending heavily on ads.

        The first step is identifying the right customer segment. Once you
        know your audience, focus on solving their problems efficiently and
        creating a feedback loop that helps you improve your offering.

        Tools like A/B testing, referral programs, and freemium models can
        help accelerate growth when used strategically.

      <p>
        Growth hacking refers to using creative, low-cost strategies to help
        businesses acquire and retain customers. Instead of relying solely
        on traditional marketing, it focuses on quick experimentation across
        marketing channels, product development, and sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Dropbox famously offered free storage space to users
        who referred friends. This viral loop helped them grow exponentially
        without spending heavily on ads.

      <p>
        The first step is identifying the right customer segment. Once you
        know your audience, focus on solving their problems efficiently and
        creating a feedback loop that helps you improve your offering.
      </p>

        Tools like A/B testing, referral programs, and freemium models can

      <h2 id="what-is-growth-hack">What is growth hack?</h2>
      <p>
        Growth hacking refers to using creative, low-cost strategies to help
        businesses acquire and retain customers. Instead of relying solely
        on traditional marketing, it focuses on quick experimentation across
        marketing channels, product development, and sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Dropbox famously offered free storage space to users
        who referred friends. This viral loop helped them grow exponentially
        without spending heavily on ads.

      <p>
        Growth hacking refers to using creative, low-cost strategies to help
        businesses acquire and retain customers. Instead of relying solely
        on traditional marketing, it focuses on quick experimentation across
        marketing channels, product development, and sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Dropbox famously offered free storage space to users
        who referred friends. This viral loop helped them grow exponentially
        without spending heavily on ads.

        The first step is identifying the right customer segment. Once you
        know your audience, focus on solving their problems efficiently and
        creating a feedback loop that helps you improve your offering.

        Tools like A/B testing, referral programs, and freemium models can

      <h2 id="what-is-growth-hack">What is growth hack?</h2>
      <p>
        Growth hacking refers to using creative, low-cost strategies to help
        businesses acquire and retain customers. Instead of relying solely
        on traditional marketing, it focuses on quick experimentation across
        marketing channels, product development, and sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Dropbox famously offered free storage space to users
        who referred friends. This viral loop helped them grow exponentially
        without spending heavily on ads.

      <h2 id="how-to-start-growing-business">How to start growing business?</h2>
      <p>
        The first step is identifying the right customer segment. Once you
        know your audience, focus on solving their problems efficiently and
        creating a feedback loop that helps you improve your offering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tools like A/B testing, referral programs, and freemium models can

      <h2 id="intro">Introduction to Neural Nets</h2>
      <p>
        Neural networks are machine learning models inspired by the human brain.
        They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process
        information in a way similar to biological systems.
      </p>

      <h2 id="types">Types of Neural Networks</h2>
      <p>
        Common types include Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional
        Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Each has
        specialized use cases, like image recognition or natural language
        processing.
      </p>

      <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Neural networks are used in autonomous driving, fraud detection,
        recommendation engines, and even generating art. With enough training
        data, they can outperform traditional rule-based systems in many domains.
      </p>

      <h2 id="future">The Future of Neural Nets</h2>
      <p>
        Research is moving toward more energy-efficient models, explainable AI,
        and hybrid architectures that combine symbolic reasoning with deep
        learning for more robust intelligence.
